# -Virtual-Retail-Store-

Created the basic document layout of each webpage using HTML5 to replicate famous online stores such as amazon.com. 
Enumerated each element in each webpage with a design theme for simpler and better user intractability using CSS3 and Bootstrap framework. 
Used JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and jQuery library to add animations to buttons and other elements to bring ‘life’ to the whole app. 
Linked the app to a backend MySQL database using PHP to aid users search and purchase items as they wish.
